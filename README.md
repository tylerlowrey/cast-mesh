# cast-mesh
A tool for collecting data from IoT devices located on a single local network. This project is intended to help with the process of data collection 
between IoT devices that are located on a single local network. It's use of protobuf & gRPC will allow easy customization by generating code stubs
that allow custom implementations based upon the IoT device use-case.

This project was created for my Systems Administration & Security class at Clemson University

## Current Features
- Basic UI that is built using a React webapp

## Planned Features
- Remove dependency on a shared sqlite database between data collection server code and ui backend code
